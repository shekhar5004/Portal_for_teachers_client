# PORTAL FOR TEACHERS 

This is a prototype for a digital platform  for the Government teachers of Bihar, India.

## Motivation:

 The teachers of Bihar have a short hand when it comes to use digital things.
 Although they are good at their work, but because they don't know the impact digitalization can have on their life
 they have to face  difficulties.
 Be it a basic salary statement to the very basic details of his job He had to give money to retrieve the data.
 This platform deals with the basic problems of maintaining and retrieval of the data of the teachers, so that all these 
 corruptions can be minimized and the Government teachers of Bihar can also cope up with the fast moving world.
